## Introducing

An easy-to-use and lightweight Java app for forwarding TCP connections: forward all TCP connections from the port that listening.
The start.bat is an example for normal users.
You may use that on a server.

---
## How-to-use, step by steps
Using TcpForward is very easy. Step by steps:
1. Install Java 1.8+ if you don't have a Java. (Tips: Please enable the "PATH"!)

> [JDKs on Oracle Web](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
---
2. Download TcpForward in the [Releases](https://github.com/SkidMeow/TcpForward/releases) page.
---
3. Create a starting batchfile or start by console.
---
Batchfile example:
```batchfile
@echo off
echo TcpForward will start...
java -jar TcpForward.jar
pause>nul
```
Start by Console:
`java -jar TcpForward.jar`
<br>
Okay there's no differenceðŸ˜‚

---
4. Close TcpForward and edit the configuration and restart.


That's so easy and you don't need the suggestions ;)
